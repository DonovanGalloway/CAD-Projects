#### Introduction

My name is Donovan Galloway, and today i would like to discuss with you the 3 Cloud Application projects 
i would like to create. They are a trouble ticket application for smart phones, a database for organizational computer 
tracking with Graphical User Interface on the front end, a messaging application to be companioned with the trouble ticket 
application. 

#### I.T Hero (Trouble Ticket Application for Smart Phones)

Built in Visual Studio, this application is heavily geared to be a resource used by a help-desk technician on the go. It 
would allow the information technology specialist in and organization to provide his/her desk side support and give them a 
tool that allows them to submit a assistance request on a users behalf for issues with a computer that cannot be resolved at 
his/her level of control. This application would be built using an easy to understand interface that allow for ease of input. The 
technician will input the users user-name, user email address, date issue was reported, computer system information to included 
the operating system, a brief description of the issue, any troubleshooting steps that were taken, point of contact name, 
point of contact email. After submitting the information the 'Ticket' would be placed in a que, and an email would be sent to 
notify the user that a ticket has been created on his/her behalf and also to the administrator who would be able to assist in 
the resolution of the issue. 

#### A Database that Tracks Organizational Computer Systems

Built in SQL, this application will allow a user to query the information set within their dataset. This database will consist
of all the information of the computer systems of the organization. The information within the database will consist of computer
names, computer type, computer make, computer model, operating system, operating system version, operating system version
variation...i.e 32bit or 64bit, the types of processor, type of graphics, and how much random access memory is installed. The 
database will the user to quickly review what the organization has without having to go out and touch the actual physical 
device. The input will be simplified as all data with this database will be input and viewable via a graphical user application.
I have yet to determine what i would name this application.

#### Messaging application to companion I.T. Hero

The purpose of this application would enable the recipient of the ticket submitted on their behalf with the I.T. Hero 
application to be able to see the status of their ticket in real time. It would also allow their user or the point of contact 
to be able to chat with the assigned technician for their issue. At the technician side it would allow them the ability to 
check their work. It will also allow technician to technician interaction in the event that the assigned tech is not familiar 
with how to fix issue they are assigned with.

#### Conclusion

The purpose of this project write up on Cloud Application projects is to introduce MSSA Cohort to my ideas for projects I am 
considering for my individual project. In this document i discussed my three ideas for projects i would like to create/code.
Please provide feedback in a way that is constructive and will better assist me in the creation of my project.
